## Welcome to RAC Trainer

Rhythmic Auditory Cueing (RAC) is a form of rehabilitation that utilizes a recurring beat or rhythm to offer an external cue to influence and improve motor skills, espcially gait. However, the notion of extracting a beat and keeping the same rhythm is challenging for humans, especially if the human has a neurological disorder such as Parkinson's Disease. If disruption to the brain's neural networks occur, by accident or by through neurological disorder, it can affect auditory-motor synchronization to a rhythm. 

This is where RAC Trainer comes into play. Similar to how a metronome helps a musician stay on tempo, rhythmic stimulation or RAC provides an effective approach to improving gait parameters. RAC Trainer is an online game that allows users to visit a website and conduct interval RAC training from the comfort of their own homes.

## User Functionality

From the user's perspective, a user can visit the website, register or login to an account, choose the parameters for your rhythm training session, and then play the game. When finished, a score for accuracy will be displayed to the screen.
